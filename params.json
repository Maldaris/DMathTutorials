Induction occurs in two steps, the base step, proving the initial equality, or \"base\" case, usually where `n = 0` or `n = 1`. The Induction step, from which the technique gets its name, occurs when looking at the `n = n+1` step. It's easiest to show directly, so let's get started.\r\n\r\nThe most common example is \r\n[common example](\"http://Tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/001.gif\")\r\n\r\nFor this, you start by solving for the base step, `n = 1`\r\n\r\n[002](\"http://Tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/002.gif\")\r\n\r\nOnce you have that, prove the next step, where `n = n+1`\r\n\r\n[003](\"http://Tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/003.gif\")\r\n\r\nDifference is here, we can assume the above holds true as well. Using this, we substitute for the case above on the left.\r\n\r\n[004](\"http://Tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/004.giff\")\r\n\r\nThus, induction!\r\n\r\n### Relational Matrices on Directional Graphs, and their use. ###\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
