Induction occurs in two steps, the base step, proving the initial equality, or \"base\" case, usually where `n = 0` or `n = 1`. The Induction step, from which the technique gets its name, occurs when looking at the `n = n+1` step. It's easiest to show directly, so let's get started.\r\n\r\nThe most common example is \r\n![common example](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/001.gif)\r\n\r\nFor this, you start by solving for the base step, `n = 1`\r\n\r\n![002](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/002.gif)\r\n\r\nOnce you have that, prove the next step, where `n = n+1`\r\n\r\n![003](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/003.gif)\r\n\r\nDifference is here, we can assume the above holds true as well. Using this, we substitute for the case above on the left.\r\n\r\n![004](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/004.gif)\r\n\r\nThus, induction!\r\n\r\n### Relational Matrices on Directional Graphs, and their use. ###\r\n\r\nDirectional Graphs are easily interpreted by humans in their visual vertex/edge form. However computers can quickly calculate and analyse graphs using the relational matrix form. \r\n\r\nGiven the graph \r\n\r\n![graph](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/005.png)\r\n\r\nWe can create the relational matrix, where rows and columns correspond to a, b, and c in that order.\r\n\r\n![matrix](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/006.gif)\r\n\r\nUsing this true/false matrix, we can determine the basic relational properties, **Reflexive** ,**Symmetric**, and **Transitive**\r\n\r\n#Reflexive#\r\n\r\n![matrix_reflex](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/007.gif)\r\n\r\n#Symmetric#\r\n\r\n![matrix_symmetric](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/008.gif)\r\n\r\n#Transitive#\r\n\r\n![cheating, matrix_symmetric again](http://tarlach.github.io/DMathTutorials/008.gif)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
