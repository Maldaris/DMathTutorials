Induction occurs in two steps, the base step, proving the initial equality, or \"base\" case, usually where `n = 0` or `n = 1`. The Induction step, from which the technique gets its name, occurs when looking at the `n = n+1` step. It's easiest to show directly, so let's get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
